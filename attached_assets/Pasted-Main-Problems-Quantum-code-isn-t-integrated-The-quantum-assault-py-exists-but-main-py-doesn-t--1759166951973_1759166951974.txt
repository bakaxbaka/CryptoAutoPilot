Main Problems:

Quantum code isn't integrated - The quantum_assault.py exists but main.py doesn't use it
Weak key recovery - The current ECDSA attack implementation is basic compared to your Java reference
Missing validation - No proper signature validation or error handling
Qiskit errors - 309 LSP diagnostics in quantum_assault.py need fixing
Poor WIF handling - Limited private key format conversion
Your Java Code Shows Better Patterns:

Robust signature validation and error handling
Proper ECDSA nonce reuse attack implementation
Professional WIF conversion with compression support
Structured vulnerability detection with detailed reporting
Clean separation of concerns
What We Should Improve
1. Enhanced Key Recovery Engine

Implement the robust two-step ECDSA attack from your Java code
Add proper signature validation and error handling
Improve WIF conversion with both compressed/uncompressed formats
Add detailed vulnerability reporting
2. Quantum Integration

Fix the 309 qiskit import and syntax errors
Integrate quantum algorithms (Shor's, Grover's) with the main scanning engine
Add quantum-enhanced vulnerability detection
Sync quantum results with the web dashboard
3. Code Organization

Structure the codebase properly (separate modules for attacks, quantum, validation)
Fix deprecated SQLAlchemy imports
Add proper logging and error handling
Implement the security improvements from your analysis
4. Enhanced Web Interface

Show quantum scan results in the dashboard
Display recovered private keys with proper formatting
Add vulnerability severity scoring
Real-time quantum analysis progress
Would you like me to create a structured plan to implement these improvements? I can organize the work into specific tasks that will:

Fix the qiskit quantum code integration
Replace the basic key recovery with your robust Java-inspired implementation
Add quantum-enhanced vulnerability detection
Improve the web interface to show quantum results
Clean up the codebase structure
