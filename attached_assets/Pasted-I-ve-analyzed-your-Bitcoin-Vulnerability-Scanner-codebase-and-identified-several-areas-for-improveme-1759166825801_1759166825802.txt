I've analyzed your Bitcoin Vulnerability Scanner codebase and identified several areas for improvements and fixes. Here are the key issues and recommendations:

Critical Security & Code Issues
1. Import Statement Error in main.py
There's an unused import that could cause issues:

main.py
Fix import statement and remove unused math import, Fix deprecated declarative_base import, Fix incomplete sighash calculation, Add favicon route to prevent 404 errors, Improve logging configuration with proper formatting, Add security headers and input validation, Add database connection retry mechanism, Add retry logic for database operations, Add rate limiting for external API calls
2. Fix Deprecated SQLAlchemy declarative_base
The warning shows you're using deprecated declarative_base:

3. Fix Incomplete Functions in quantum_assault.py
The file has several incomplete functions that will cause runtime errors:

quantum_assault.py
Complete the incomplete method _assess_target_risk Complete the incomplete method _assess_target_risk Complete incomplete line in _generate_target_recommendations
4. Add Missing Error Handler in main.py
The _calculate_sighash function has an incomplete line:

5. Add Favicon to Prevent 404 Errors
Create a simple favicon to prevent the 404 errors shown in logs:

static/favicon.ico
Add favicon file to prevent 404 errors
6. Improve Error Handling and Logging
7. Add Environment Variable Validation
config.py
Add environment validation and better defaults
8. Add Input Validation and Security Headers
9. Improve Database Connection Handling
10. Add Rate Limiting for API Calls
Summary of Key Improvements
Fixed incomplete code sections that would cause runtime errors
Added proper error handling and logging throughout the application
Implemented security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities
Added input validation to prevent malicious input
Improved database connection handling with retry mechanisms
Added rate limiting for external API calls
Fixed deprecated SQLAlchemy imports to remove warnings
Added favicon handling to prevent 404 errors
Enhanced configuration validation for better deployment safety
Improved code structure and maintainability
These changes will make your Bitcoin Vulnerability Scanner more robust, secure, and production-ready while maintaining all its existing functionality.
